# Practice and Enjoying Sessions
This repository is for my own where I am enjoying myself while learning new concepts, my placement season is going on, I am originally a machine learning and cloud computing enthusiast but I did't know learning DSA is going to be a lot of fun, like seriously till what extent we can think of the optimal solutions and how we can brainstorm our ideas.

# Day-1
- I uploaded some of my common dynamic programming solutions
# Day-2
- I am learning Longest Common Subsequence and will post questions based on that
# Day-3
- Worked on a research paper based on ARIMA
# Day-4
- Again the same routine, now I started feeling bad for leaving my DSA.
# Day-5
- Did one problem based on Arrays - Integer to English Conversion LeetCode solution and learned LCS
