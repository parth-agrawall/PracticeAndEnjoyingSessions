# Practice and Enjoying Sessions
This repository is for my own where I am enjoying myself while learning new concepts, my placement season is going on, I am originally a machine learning and cloud computing enthusiast, but I didn't know learning DSA is going to be a lot of fun, like seriously till what extent we can think of the optimal solutions and how we can brainstorm our ideas.

# Day-1
- I uploaded some of my common dynamic programming solutions
# Day-2
- I am learning Longest Common Subsequence and will post questions based on that
# Day-3
- Worked on a research paper based on ARIMA
# Day-4
- Again the same routine, now I started feeling bad for leaving my DSA.
# Day-5
- Did one problem based on Arrays - Integer to English Conversion LeetCode solution and learned LCS
# Day-6
- Learned more problems based on LCS like Longest Common Substring
- yes, there is difference in both longest common subsequence and longest common substring, in the longest common subsequence we find the maximum length of common characters in both strings whereas in the longest common subsequence we find the maximum length of continuous substring
- it's amazing right ðŸ˜­ðŸ”¥
# Day-7 to Day- 17
-  Had exams, seriously telling this phase of not doing anything was too bad, I really felt guilty for not practicing and leaving just like this.
-  <b> Tip: Keep always practicing, never leave your flow just like this, if you do this, it will take time to come again on the same track. :) </b>
# Day-8
-  Learned and solved Dynamic Programming questions like Longest Increasing Subsequence and many more
